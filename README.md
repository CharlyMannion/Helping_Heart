## Objectives
Before getting started and settling on the idea for our final project, our team discussed and defined our objectives for the next two weeks:
* Build game that people would want to play in years to come
* Learn Phaser
* Write clean, readable code and ensure knowledge sharing
* Follow an agile approach; daily stand-ups, check-ins and retros
* Pairing and effective team communication
* Have fun!

## Approach
* When we had agreed our objectives, we defined the idea for our app
* We wrote user stories and added them to a trello board
* With the idea in place, we began exploring the possible technologies
* We decided to use Phaser with React
* The team began by spiking React in small applications
* When we felt we had a basic understanding of the technology, we defined our MVP 
* We defined our first week long sprint, to build our MVP, and began working on tickets in pairs
* We stuck to our objectives and had daily stand-ups, check-ins retros, and knowledge sharing sessions
* We used a Trello board to track our progress

```
git clone https://github.com/CharlyMannion/final_project.git
```
* Go into the project directory:
```
cd final_project
```
* Open the app in your favourite text editor to view the code (We like VSCode):
```
code .
```
* To install all dependencies, in your terminal type:
```
npm i
```
* To launch the react app:
```
npm start
```

## Running Tests
```
npm test
```

## User Stories
```
As a user, 
so I can play as myself, 
I want to see a landing page where I can enter a name




```

## Employer Stories
```
```

## Developer Stories
```
```

## Week One: MVP
* By the end of week one, we were thrilled to reach our MVP! Although it's safe to say we were knackered
* We had a sprite that could run around in our game and a dialog box that would pop up and allow the player to help NCPs
* Check out some screenshots of our game by the end of week 1:
Player enters a username and presses play

Player walked towards the NCP using W,A,S,D keys:

Player enters the zone of an NCP:

Players presses the space bar, and a dialog box appears:

Player chooses whether or not to help the NCP. There is a visual indicator that a button has been clicked on the screen ("true"). The player is only able to enter the zone of each NCP once:

## Week Two: 
* At the start of week two, we defined our second week-long sprint

## Challenges
* One of our main challenges was getting to grips with Phaser, and using it in conjunction with React
* We faced a few teething issues with tiled, and required a few iterations in order to get our layers how we wanted them
* We also came into trouble when merging our branches, due to the fact that Phaser needs to be written in one huge file

## Successes
* We all felt a huge sense of achievement when we got Phaser working, and celebrated our team's success
* We were great at swapping pairs regularly and sharing knowledge, so it felt like we all had a really great knowledge of how our app was working, and got to work on different aspects of the game
