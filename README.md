## Objectives
Before getting started and settling on the idea for our final project, our team discussed and defined our objectives for the next two weeks:
* Build game that people would want to play in years to come
* Learn Phaser
* Write clean, readable code and ensure knowledge sharing
* Follow an agile approach; daily stand-ups, check-ins and retros
* Pairing and effective team communication
* Have fun!

## Approach
* When we had agreed our objectives, we defined the idea for our app
* We wrote user stories and added them to a trello board
* With the idea in place, we began exploring the possible technologies
* We decided to use Phaser with React
* The team began by spiking React in small applications
* When we felt we had a basic understanding of the technology, we defined our MVP 
* We defined our first week long sprint, to build our MVP, and began working on tickets in pairs
* We stuck to our objectives and had daily stand-ups, check-ins retros, and knowledge sharing sessions

## Technologies Used
* Phaser
* React
* Javascript
* Tiled
